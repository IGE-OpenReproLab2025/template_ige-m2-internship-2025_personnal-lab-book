# My personnal Lab Book 

Template repository for storing your work on a daily basis. 

We recommand that you store in this repository one notebook per day and per task, following an explicit naming convention, as for instance '2025-03-12_testing-this-new-method.ipynb'. 

For this repository to be used as a lab book, you should not modify your notebooks afterwards, but create new ones everyday.  

You may also store here .py file  containings functions and objects which you often use but that are not yet packaged in specific libraries. 

Make you to commit to this repository at the end of each day of work. 

The material gathered in this space will then be used for preparing the material you would like to share with your collaborators on the project.
